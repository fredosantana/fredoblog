Recently I inteded to go to a job fair. I got 25 copies of my resume ready to show off to potential employers. Before the job fair started I decided to have breakfast and use that time to come up with talking points.

As I wrote down what were my hard and soft skills as well as potential answers to interview questions, I looked over my resume and realized there's no way I can turn that in to potential employers. It was far too specific to a particular industry. At that moment I decided to not attend the job fair as this resume did not entirely reflect my professional growth. More importantly it generally failed to communicate what value I can add to a potential employer.

### Re-inventing the resume

The first step I took was to take my list of skills and somehow capsulate it into a one page resume.

I researched various resume writing sites and while they all had differing points of view as to what should and shouldn't go into a resume, the common message was to keep a resume as consise as possible. After much consideration into what format I should use, I went with the hybrid/combination resume. The reason for this is because while I had a lengthy stint with my most recent employer in the affordable housing industry where presentation and people skills were paramount, I also took web development courses in my spare time. To me this format is the best way to present both sides to potential employers. 

While the content of a resume is considered most important, I also had to consider the layout and overall presentation. I found many great looking resumes just by looking at Google Images as well as the templates provided on Google Docs, I decided to challenge myself by taking a template format and building it from scratch. The end result was satisfying to say the least.

Suddenly feeling inspired I've gone ahead with also making some much needed updates to my web developer portfolio. I'll save that one for the next post. :)
